# Aperturama-Backend

An app that helps you back up and sync your media to a server under your control. Written in Node.js and Express. Depends on the [frontend app](https://github.com/Aperturama/Aperturama-Frontend) for most functionality.

## Build Information
With a valid Docker and Docker Compose installation, you should be able to run `docker compose up -d --build` to start the backend. The API will then be available on port 3000.
